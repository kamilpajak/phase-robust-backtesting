"""Multi-phase aggregator — collapse phase-aliasing in strided backtests.

`BacktestEngine.rebalance_stride > 1` samples 1-in-stride trading days as
rebalances. Different phases (start-of-stride offsets) sample disjoint
trading days, producing wildly different point-estimate Sharpes for the
same strategy on the same period (30-77pp/y swings observed; see
`docs/research/methodology_audit_2026_04_29.md`).

Aggregating across all `stride` phases gives a stable distributional
estimate. This module is the small library piece; experiment scripts call
`summarise_phase_results(...)` after looping engine runs over
`phase_offset = 0..stride-1`.
